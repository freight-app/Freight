# Cargo vs Freight

Freight is deliberately modelled after Cargo. If you know Cargo, most concepts map directly.

---

## Manifest

| Concept | Cargo (`Cargo.toml`) | Freight (`freight.toml`) |
|---|---|---|
| Package metadata | `[package]` | `[package]` — same fields |
| Binary target | `[[bin]]` | `[[bin]]` — same shape; supports `required-features` |
| Example target | `[[example]]` + `examples/` | `[[example]]` + `examples/` — auto-discovered; `--example`/`--examples` |
| Default binary | `[package] default-run` | `[package] default-run` — same |
| Library target | `[lib]` | `[lib]` — adds `type = "static \| shared \| header-only"` |
| Features | `[features]` | `[features]` — same syntax; active features emit `-D<NAME>` |
| Build profiles | `[profile.dev]`, `[profile.release]` | `[profile.dev]`, `[profile.release]` — same keys |
| Dependencies | `[dependencies]` | `[dependencies]` — extended (see below) |
| Dev dependencies | `[dev-dependencies]` | `[dev-dependencies]` — debug builds + tests only |
| Build-time tools | `[build-dependencies]` (for build.rs) | `[build-dependencies]` — executables needed during compilation; `bin/` prepended to PATH |
| Build script | `build.rs` | Not supported |
| Workspaces | `[workspace]` in root `Cargo.toml` | Same — `[workspace.dependencies]` / `[workspace.package]` inheritance via `{ workspace = true }` |
| Dependency source override | `[patch]` / `[replace]` | `[patch]` — path overrides (across the whole graph, incl. transitive) |

### Differences in `[lib]`

Freight requires `type = "static" | "shared" | "header-only"` — Cargo infers this from the crate type. `header-only` skips compilation and just exposes include paths to dependents.

### No `[package] edition`

Freight has no language edition concept. Language standards are set per-language under `[language.<key>]`:

```toml
[language.cpp]
std = "c++20"

[language.c]
std = "c17"
```

### Platform-conditional sections

Freight adds `[os.<key>]` and `[arch.<key>]` sections that Cargo handles with `cfg()` attributes in code. Files listed in these sections are completely excluded from the build on non-matching platforms — they are never compiled, not just conditionally skipped.

```toml
[os.linux]
srcs     = ["src/os/linux/**"]
defines  = ["PLATFORM_LINUX"]
features = ["pthread"]

[os.windows]
srcs = ["src/os/windows/**"]
```

## Dependencies

### What's the same

| Kind | Cargo | Freight |
|---|---|---|
| Path dep | `{ path = "../mylib" }` | `{ path = "../mylib" }` |
| Git dep | `{ git = "...", tag = "v1" }` | `{ url = "....git", tag = "v1" }` — git URL + ref |
| Dev dep | `[dev-dependencies]` | `[dev-dependencies]` |
| Build-time tool | `[build-dependencies]` | `[build-dependencies]` — different semantics: no build.rs, tools go on PATH |
| Feature selection | `{ features = ["tls"] }` | `{ features = ["tls"] }` |
| Default features | `{ default-features = false }` | `{ default-features = false }` |

### What's different

Cargo resolves Rust crates from crates.io. Freight resolves C/C++ libraries through a chain:

1. **pkg-config** — `pkg-config --modversion <name>`
2. **System-lib stub** — bundled stubs for common OS libraries (pthread, zlib, OpenSSL, …)
3. **Registry** — `.deps/` cache populated by `freight fetch`

Pin a specific resolver with `repo` (`"system"` for stubs only, or a named registry):
```toml
zlib = { version = "1.3", repo = "system" }
```

### What Freight adds

**URL archive dependency** — not in Cargo:
```toml
json = { url = "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/archive/refs/tags/v3.11.3.tar.gz", sha256 = "..." }
```

**Foreign build system deps** — CMake, Meson, Autotools, Make, Bazel, SCons:
```toml
SDL2 = { path = "../SDL2", type = "cmake", defines = ["SDL_STATIC=ON"] }
```

**System libraries** — resolved via pkg-config → stub → registry from a bare version:
```toml
openssl = "3.0"
```

**Versionless system libraries** — linked via `[os.*] features`, not a dep entry:
```toml
[os.unix]
features = ["pthread"]   # -lpthread on Unix

[os.windows]
features = ["ws2_32"]    # -lws2_32 on Windows
```

### Build flags

Available on `freight build` / `run` / `test` and other build-engine commands.

### Command aliases

| Cargo | Freight |
|---|---|

```toml
[alias]
b  = "build"
br = ["build", "--release"]
```

An alias may not shadow a built-in subcommand; local entries override global.

## What Cargo has that Freight does not

- **`build.rs`** — pre-build Rust scripts. Freight has no equivalent; platform-conditional logic belongs in `[os.*]`/`[arch.*]` sections.
- **Procedural macros** — not applicable to C/C++.
- **`cargo fix`** — Freight's `freight lint --fix` is the closest equivalent.
- **Workspaces with virtual manifests** — Freight workspaces require each member to have its own `freight.toml`; virtual root manifests are not supported yet. (Dependency and package-field inheritance via `{ workspace = true }` *is* supported.)
- **Edition system** — no concept of language editions; standards are set explicitly.

## What Freight has that Cargo does not

- **Multi-language builds** — C, C++, Fortran, CUDA, HIP, D, OpenCL, and assembly in one project.
- **Foreign build system integration** — pull in CMake/Meson/Autotools deps natively.
- **`[os.*]` / `[arch.*]` source routing** — platform-specific source files declared in the manifest.
- **`freight debug`** — integrated GDB/LLDB launcher and VS Code `launch.json` generator.
- **`freight compile-commands`** — `compile_commands.json` for language server integration.
- **Prebuilt binary publishing** — `freight publish --prebuilt` uploads a binary tarball alongside source.
- **CPU extension flags** — `[target] cpu-extensions = ["avx2", "fma"]` emits `-mavx2 -mfma`.
