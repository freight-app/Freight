# TODO

## Big tasks

### B1 — Registry client integration
The `freight-registry` server lives in a separate repository and is fully operational. Multiple-registry
client support is done. All publisher/consumer CLI commands are wired to real HTTP calls:
`freight search`, `freight info`, `freight login`, `freight publish`, `freight yank`, `freight register`.

Remaining: implement `freight fetch` for registry version deps (download tarballs to `.deps/` and
record `source = "registry+<url>"` + checksum in `freight.lock`), and add semver resolution +
lockfile pinning to `freight add` so `version = "1.2"` deps work end-to-end.
Blocks: registry-backed `version = "x.y"` resolution in `freight build`.

### B2 — VS Code extension
Activate on `freight.toml`, delegate to `freight lsp` for diagnostics, completions, and
go-to-definition. LSP currently implemented; remaining work is the extension packaging and
Marketplace publish. Also add inlay hints and `freight.toml` schema validation.

### B3 — Progress callbacks / structured build events ✓ done
`BuildEvent` enum + `Progress = Arc<dyn Fn(BuildEvent) + Send + Sync>` threaded through the
entire build pipeline. CLI translates events to coloured output. GUI/TUI/LSP can subscribe
without parsing stdout. All `println!`/`eprintln!` removed from `freight-core` build paths.

### B4 — Slot-based substitution ✓ done
`provides = [...]` currently only detects conflicts. Full substitution: the dep declared
closest to the root wins; same-depth conflicts remain a hard error. Required before large
dependency graphs with BLAS/LAPACK-style provider aliases are usable.

### B5 — Package lookup chain expansion ✓ done
Version deps resolve via `pkg-config → conan → vcpkg → system-lib stub`. `repo = "system"|"conan"|"vcpkg"|"pkg-config"` pins a specific resolver. System PM detection (apt/brew/dnf/pacman/zypper/winget) emits install hints on failure. `conan.rs`, `system_pm.rs`, and `system_libs.rs` modules added. 24 built-in stubs in `toolchains/system-libs/` cover common OS primitives (pthread, ws2_32, libm, dl, rt, d3d11, …). Users can add stubs to `~/.freight/toolchains/system-libs/`.
Remaining: internal system cache registry (index on first install; skip probing on rebuild).

### B6 — `freight bench` ✓ done
`bench` profile (release + debug, no strip), run binaries matching `bench_*` or in `benches/`,
print a timing table. Optional Criterion integration via a flag.

## Small tasks

### S1 — Tab completion ✓ done
Generate shell completions (bash, zsh, fish) for all subcommands and their options.
When the user presses tab under `freight add`, offer known dep keys; under
`freight toolchain use`, offer detected compiler names.

### S2 — `freight outdated`
Compare locked path-dep revs and registry versions against latest available.
Print a coloured table. Analogous to `cargo outdated`.

### S3 — Better compiler diagnostics ✓ done
GCC/Clang column markers and MSVC error codes are parsed into concise
summaries with clickable `file:line:col` references and source snippets.

### S4 — `freight graph` ✓ done
Emits the dependency graph as DOT or Mermaid to stdout or a file. Useful for
auditing transitive deps in large projects.

### S5 — `--emit asm` ✓ done
`freight build --emit asm` — runs an extra `-S` pass for each source file and
writes `.s` files to `target/{profile}/asm/`, preserving the source tree structure.
Skips pure-assembler sources (gas/nasm/yasm). Non-fatal: failures are surfaced as
warnings rather than aborting the build. Normal object compilation and linking still happen.

### S6 — `--time-passes` ✓ done
`freight build --time-passes` — instruments every `compile_one` call, emits
`BuildEvent::Timing` events, then prints a per-file table sorted slowest-first after
the build completes. Uses the `FREIGHT_TIME_PASSES` env var internally so rayon workers
can record timings without changing function signatures.

### S7 — Profile inheritance ✓ done
`[profile.custom] inherits = "release"; debug = true` — fully implemented:
`resolve_profile` walks the `inherits` chain (max 16 hops, cycle-safe), merges
parent→child with child fields winning when `Some`/non-empty.

### S8 — Sanitizer preset override via CLI ✓ done
`freight test --sanitize address,undefined` — `apply_sanitize_override` patches the
active profile's sanitize list; `--sanitize` is wired through `build`, `test`, and `run`.

### S9 — `rerun_if` in `build.freight`
`rerun_if_changed("path")` and `rerun_if_env_changed("VAR")` — skip re-running
the build script when declared inputs haven't changed.

### S10 — `compile_commands.json` incremental update ✓ done
Cache the previous output and source mtimes under `target/{profile}/`; only re-emit entries
for sources that changed or when command-affecting settings change.

### S11 — `FREIGHT_SYSROOT` env auto-propagation ✓ done
When `FREIGHT_SYSROOT` is set, inject `--sysroot=` automatically without
requiring `[compiler] sysroot` in the manifest.

### S12 — Template evaluation cache ✓ done
Cache parsed `.rhai` template results to `~/.freight/template-cache.msgpack`.
Cache key = per-file content hash + base-file hash. `CompilerTemplate` and
serializable nested template metadata derive `Serialize`/`Deserialize`; templates
with runtime option handlers are evaluated live so their callbacks remain active.

### S13 — macOS / Windows distribution packages ✓ done
`freight package --target x86_64-windows` produces a `.zip` instead of `.tar.gz`.
Windows targets emit and install `.exe` binaries, with shared-library packaging
using the existing Windows DLL/import-lib layout for MinGW or Windows sysroots.

### S14 — Unity / jumbo builds ✓ done
`[compiler] unity = true` — concatenate all TUs per language into one translation
unit via `#include`. Trades incremental speed for full-build speed and better cross-TU
inlining. Applies to C, C++, CUDA, HIP, OpenCL; other languages compile individually.
Per-dep override: `mylib = { path = "../mylib", unity = true }`.
C++20 named-module projects skip unity (modules have their own dependency ordering).

### S15 — Workspace per-member feature flags ✓ done
`freight build -p mylib --features tls` — build/test/bench/run a single workspace
member and pass features to it. `freight run -p myapp` runs a member's binary.
Remaining: workspace-level `[patch]` overrides, `freight workspace graph` visualisation.
